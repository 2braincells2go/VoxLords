# VoxLords
VoxLords is a ThreeJS WebGL game with a simple voxel engine. It also provides a implementation for loading .vox files that are created with MagicaVoxel (https://voxel.codeplex.com/).

** The code is free to use but I would appreciate if you give me credit when using it. **

I haven't had time to create some description of the code layout but if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

## Testing

Install nodejs and run * "cd server; nodejs server.js" *. Then point your browser to * http://localhost:8081 *
